I'm a developer that loves simplicity. You might ask but what if a problem involves complex solutions? To that, I would 
say isn't a complex system/function/method just a collection of simple choices?
Simple is maintainable. Simple is readable. Most importantly simple is easy to debug when something urgent arises.

Over the years I've dabbled in various areas of the stack (Front-End, DevOps, Back-End). My philosophy is to only look 
at new frameworks or tools when they truly change the ecosystem like the introduction of React or Kubernetes. As I've 
learned more, I have grown to appreciate opinionated tools that make decisions for me and speed up my development like 
Next.js.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me:
- watching Manchester United
- hiking 
- running in Piedmont Park
- playing soccer
