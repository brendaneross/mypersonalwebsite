I can't count the number of times that I've almost brought myself to learning React. 
It's quite different from the legacy systems I see in my day job. Even though my coworkers and I have created a flexible template that takes some inspiration from components, it just isn't the same.\
\
I guess that explains why it took me this long to 
give it a chance. Oh how wrong I was...

To start off, this site runs on a React framework called Next.js.

Why did I go with a framework might be your first question. My first answer would be, because Next helps with routing, dynamic content, and other optimizations that React doesn't come with out of the box.  

Did I mention that Next is _FAST_?

In addition to Next.js, I used Chakra UI which seemed like a nice change of pace from Bootstrap and not as involved as Tailwind.
While all of this took some getting used to, at the end of the day, my build speed picked up rapidly as I got more involved with the system.  While React itself has a few gotchas here and there (hooks, props, state)... it just takes time to get used to it.
I don't see why businesses haven't killed off the app market and fully embraced the PWA market.
