If you're a securities (or options) trader, you've probably heard of Robinhood. If you haven't, well... their goal is to democratize wealth. While it is a nice goal to have, they didn't exactly live up to those expectations.  They produced a free trading platform, 
which is a neat idea, but like all free things, there is always a catch. They were getting paid for order flow.  In addition 
to that, they also had some infrastructure issues and a lot of downtime. The GME saga was the straw that broke the camel's back.\
\
As a result of that I decided to make Thinkorchart.  Thinkorchart is a dashboard that fetches data from TD Ameritrade's APIs, the same ones they use for thinkorswim. With the absence of Robinhood's lovely portfolio UI, I felt the need to create something to track my own growth.\

Thinkorchart was built with:  
React/Next, Material UI, and Bootstrap V4
